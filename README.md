# Anime Website

This project is a comprehensive data science implementation focusing on anime data. It spans from data extraction through web scraping of MyAnimeList to deploying a web page in a Quarto environment. This project demonstrates the full data workflow, from acquisition to deployment, providing a transparent and replicable approach for anime data enthusiasts. 


This repository contains the second part of the Data Architecture course project for the MCD.

Here we implement the analysis and deploy a web page in a Quarto environment.

- `AnimeAnalysis.yaml`: Conda environment file for the project.
- `config.yaml`: Project configuration file.
- `data`: Directory for storing the data used in the analysis.
- `modelos`: Directory containing the models and related files used in the analysis.
- `src`: Directory containing the project's source code.
